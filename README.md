As a skilled developer with expertise in embedded systems and LIDAR spatial mapping, I have designed and built an intelligent system that uses a time-of-flight sensor and a stepper motor to create a 3D map of the surrounding environment. 

The system incorporates a microcontroller that enables the transmission and receival of distance measurements from the sensor to a personal computer using I2C and UART protocols. I have also utilized my proficiency in Python programming and trigonometry to convert the distance measurements into cartesian form and create 3D plots. 

This project demonstrates my advanced technical skills in mathematics, programming, and hardware design, making me an ideal candidate for roles in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.
